- There is no more the nesparam.inc file. There is a new file : scf.f.

June and July 2008
- Some other bugs corrected

May 2008
- Some bugs corrected

- Photoemission calculation.
- Improvement of the MPI.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March-June 2007
- Many modification the program in order to improve the speed when working in FDM model.
  Real only with the existence of 3 fold axis and sometimes with 4 fold axis. 
- Non parallel spin axis are now possible
- With MPI, results are given continuously during the job and not just at the end.
- Different bugs were corrected.

14 February 2007
- In routine Symsite, declaration of base_orth as logical forgotten previously. Gave problem
in compilation with some compiler

6 February 2007
- Bug found and corrected for the automatic screening in magnetic configuration
when the non-excited electronic configuration is such that there is less than
 half electron free for one of the spin for the orbital where comes the screening electron
(very rare situation).
- Establishment of the groups of equivalent atoms made less memory consuming. Previously
when the number of non-equivalent atoms was to high one got stack overflow.

19 January 2007
- Bug found and corrected when symmetry plane along y=z (or x=z) and no symmetry
 plane for y=0 and z=0 (or x=0 and z=0). (occurred just in FDM).

15 January 2007
- Bug found and corrected when 2 fold axis along x (or y) and symmetry plane
 along y=z (or x=z). (Occurred just in FDM).

10 January 2007
- Abnormal memory increase under MPI on some compiler corrected (by R. Wilcke)
- Bad initialization of naltm parameter corrected (previously could stop the program).

8 January 2007
- For 1 year, for the 4f elements, the screening was by default on the 5d, 
  it is now again by default on the 4f.
--> This can modify the results comparing with previous version
- Better output in bav file to get the atomic electronic configurations.
